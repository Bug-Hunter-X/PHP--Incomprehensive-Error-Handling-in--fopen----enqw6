```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle error: file not found or inaccessible
}
```

The problem lies in how the error is handled (or rather, not handled comprehensively). The `fopen()` function returns `false` on failure, but the provided code only checks if `$file` is truthy. This is insufficient, because many error states might still return a `false` value that is not explicitly checked and could lead to unexpected behavior.

In this particular case, it assumes that the only reason `fopen()` might fail is that the file doesn't exist. But there are other reasons:  incorrect permissions, the file system being unavailable, an exceeded disk quota, or the path being malformed.
