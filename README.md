# PHP: Incomprehensive Error Handling in File Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP file handling and its improved solution.

The `bug.php` file shows a naive approach to error handling during file operations using `fopen()`.  The code only checks for the success of `fopen()` without addressing various error scenarios that could still result in `false`.  This leads to incomplete error handling and potential application crashes or unexpected behavior. 

The improved solution `bugSolution.php` shows how to robustly handle errors by using `error_get_last()` and providing more informative error messages, making debugging and maintenance significantly easier.
